Proof of concept WMI virus. Does what it looks like it does.

Contains a novel privilege escalation technique and some other fun and/or novel stuff. Fully undetected by all antiviruses and sandboxing suites like virustotal. Maybe some novel AV evasion stuff, its been a while since I wrote it. Think I implemented polymorphism or dynamic runtime string encryption.
